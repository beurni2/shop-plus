/**
 * REPONSES-ENREGISTREES-1 (Boutik+ AUDIT-B+2 F-82) — WHAT THIS WORKER REALLY
 * ANSWERS on the doors Boutik+'s screen walks stand in for.
 *
 * Inert unless `REPONSES_RELEVE` names a file: then every answer the real
 * Worker gives, in any suite, on one of Shop+'s recorded doors is appended to
 * it — only observed, never altered. `scripts/certifier-reponses.mjs` runs the
 * suites this way and checks the recording against what was seen.
 *
 * WHERE IT WATCHES: `Miniflare#dispatchFetch` is an arrow function set on each
 * instance, so the class cannot be wrapped; every call sends the request
 * through the `fetch` of Miniflare's OWN copy of undici, which Miniflare reads
 * live — that is the one shared point, and it is wrapped here.
