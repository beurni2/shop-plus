/**
 * ── AUDIT-B+1 F2 / M-GATE-03 — THE UNSCANNED-DIRECTORY BLIND SPOT ──────────
 * Found by a harness audit of Boutik+; this repo shipped the identical hole.
 * `DEFAULT_ROOTS` is an allowlist, so every law gate was blind to any top-level
 * directory nobody thought to add to it. A `workers/` or `functions/` or `lib/`
 * created next year would carry a violation past a board printing ALL GATES
 * GREEN — and nothing anywhere would say so.
 *
 * The fix is not "scan everything": `scripts/` and `docs/` necessarily SPELL
 * the banned patterns (this file does), and `gates/fixtures/` exists to fail.
 * The fix is that a directory may not be silently *unclassified*. Every
 * top-level name is either a product root (scanned) or listed below with the
 * reason it is not — and a name in neither list fails the gate until a human
 * decides which it is. The blind spot becomes a build break instead of silence.
 *
 * This list is the UNION across boutik-plus, shop-plus and sera so the three
 * copies stay identical; the audit found identical blindness in all three, and
 * identical hardening is how it stays fixed.
