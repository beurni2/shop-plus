/**
 * ═══ RENDU-RÉEL (Shop+ reseller) — mount her real screen and USE it ═══
 *
 * FOUNDER STANDING ORDER (2026-08-10) — « THE SCREEN IS DRIVEN, NEVER ONLY
 * READ », which names this surface explicitly: « Where no harness exists yet
 * (Boutik+ supplier app, Shop+ buyer PWA, the Séra dispatch console): the first
 * slice that touches a screen there BUILDS the equivalent, or says plainly in
 * the report that it did not and why. »
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR, IN ONE LINE: all 39 test files in this app proved screens
 * by READING them, so a screen that renders and cannot be used was invisible
 * here exactly as it was in the rider app, where three such bugs shipped in one
 * day. The slice that built this — VITRINE-RETRAIT — turns on two things no
 * scan can see: a `useEffect` dependency (does Opportunités RE-READ?) and a new
 * control (does « Retirer » reach the service, and does the card go?).
 *
 * AND IT DRIVES THE REAL PORTS. Nothing of the app is stubbed: `App.tsx`, the
 * storefront and offer ports, the margin views and the catalog are the shipped
 * files. The ONLY thing faked is `globalThis.fetch` — so a walk exercises
 * screen → state → port → wire → parse → screen, which is every layer above the
 * Worker. (The Worker is the seam test's job, in
 * `services/storefront-service/test/vitrine-retrait.e2e.test.ts`.)
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NEVER CLAIM: appearance. See the bound stated in
 * `test/doubles/react-native.tsx` — there is no layout and no colour here.
