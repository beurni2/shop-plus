/**
 * ═══ RENDU-RÉEL (Shop+ reseller) — the react-native double, and EXACTLY what it is for ═══
 *
 * FOUNDER STANDING ORDER (2026-08-10) — « THE SCREEN IS DRIVEN, NEVER ONLY
 * READ ». He gave it after a single day in which three bugs reached his hand
 * through a fully green board, all the same shape: a screen that renders and
 * cannot be used. The order names the Shop+ reseller surface among the repos
 * with no harness, and « the first slice that touches a screen there BUILDS the
 * equivalent ». This is that build.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACES HERE: every screen test in `test/` was a SOURCE SCAN — a
 * `readFileSync` on a `.tsx` and a regex over the text. A source scan cannot see
 * what mounted, whether a press is wired, or whether an effect ran — and the two
 * changes this harness first covered are exactly that kind: a `useEffect`
 * dependency (does Opportunités RE-READ when she opens it?) and a new control
 * (does « Retirer » reach the service, and does the card go?).
 *
 * THE BOUND OF THIS DOUBLE, STATED SO NOBODY OVER-READS IT (§9.8 — « a mock
 * that makes integration look healthier than it is is a bug you own »):
 *
 *   IT PROVIDES: component identity, prop pass-through, children, and the
 *   press/change handlers. That is enough — and is exactly what is needed —
 *   to answer « did it render », « is this button wired », « did the effect
 *   run », « can he get to the next screen ».
 *
 *   IT PROVIDES NOTHING ELSE. No layout, no styling, no measurement, no
 *   gesture system, no native animation. So a test written on it may NEVER
 *   claim anything about appearance — not spacing, not contrast, not
 *   touch-target size, not animation timing. Those stay where they already
 *   live: the token-fidelity and contrast scans, and the founder's own eyes on
 *   a phone in sunlight.
 *
 * A test that asserted a colour here would be asserting a fiction. There is no
 * colour here.
 *
 * AND ITS SURFACE IS CERTIFIED, NOT GUESSED. `test/rendu-harness.test.ts`
 * sweeps every `from 'react-native'` import in the app tree and fails if this
 * file does not export it — so a new import cannot silently arrive as
 * `undefined` and render nothing while a test passes over it.
